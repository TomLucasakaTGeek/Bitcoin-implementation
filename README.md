## 🪙 What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the world's first **decentralized digital currency** that enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin solves the **double-spending problem** through a distributed ledger called the blockchain.

### Key Innovations

- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls Bitcoin
- **Cryptographic Security**: Public-key cryptography secures ownership
- **Proof of Work**: Mining ensures consensus and prevents spam
- **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist
- **Immutability**: Past transactions cannot be altered

---

## ⚙️ How Bitcoin Works

### 1. Wallets & Addresses

Every user has a **wallet** containing:
- **Private Key**: Secret number used to sign transactions (proves ownership)
- **Public Key**: Derived from private key, used for verification
- **Address**: Hash of public key, shared to receive Bitcoin

```python
# Generate a wallet
wallet = Wallet()
print(f"Address: {wallet.address}")  # Where others send you Bitcoin
```

**Analogy**: Think of the address as your email, public key as your identity, and private key as your password.

### 2. UTXO Model (Unspent Transaction Outputs)

Bitcoin doesn't track "account balances" like a bank. Instead, it tracks **UTXOs** - individual chunks of Bitcoin.

**How it works:**
- Your balance = sum of all UTXOs you own
- To spend, you must consume **entire UTXOs** and create new ones
- Change goes back to you as a new UTXO

**Example:**
```
Alice has UTXO: 50 BTC
Alice wants to send 10 BTC to Bob

Transaction:
  Input:  50 BTC UTXO (consumed completely)
  Outputs:
    - 10 BTC to Bob (new UTXO)
    - 40 BTC to Alice (change, new UTXO)
```

**Why this design?**
- ✅ Prevents double-spending (UTXO can only be spent once)
- ✅ Improves privacy (harder to track total balances)
- ✅ Enables parallel validation (transactions are independent)

### 3. Transactions

A transaction moves Bitcoin from one address to another by:
1. **Referencing inputs**: Which UTXOs are being spent
2. **Creating outputs**: New UTXOs for recipients
3. **Signing with private key**: Proves you own the inputs
4. **Broadcasting to network**: Miners include it in a block

```python
# Create transaction
tx_input = TxInput(prev_tx_hash="abc123...", prev_output_index=0)
tx_output = TxOutput(amount=10_00000000, recipient_address=bob.address)
tx = Transaction(inputs=[tx_input], outputs=[tx_output])

# Sign it
tx.sign_inputs(alice_wallet, utxo_set)

# Broadcast
blockchain.add_transaction(tx)
```

**Analogy**: Like writing a check - you reference money you have (inputs), specify who gets how much (outputs), and sign it (cryptographic signature).

### 4. Mining & Proof of Work

**What is mining?**
The process of adding new blocks to the blockchain by solving a cryptographic puzzle.

**The puzzle:**
Find a number (nonce) such that:
```
hash(block_data + nonce) < target
```

Where `target` is a number starting with N zeros (difficulty).

**Example:**
```
Difficulty = 4
Target = 0000ffffffffffffffffffff...

Try nonce = 0:     hash = 8a3f2c... ❌
Try nonce = 1:     hash = 7b2e1d... ❌
Try nonce = 2:     hash = 6c4d3f... ❌
...
Try nonce = 142857: hash = 0000abc... ✅ Found it!
```

**Why mining matters:**
- ✅ **Consensus**: Everyone agrees on transaction history
- ✅ **Security**: Changing history requires re-mining all subsequent blocks (computationally infeasible)
- ✅ **Incentives**: Miners earn rewards (new Bitcoin + transaction fees)
- ✅ **Decentralization**: Anyone can mine, no central authority

```python
# Mine a block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions(miner_address)
# Miner earns 50 BTC + transaction fees
```

### 5. Blockchain Structure

A **blockchain** is a chain of blocks, where each block contains:
- Transactions
- Previous block's hash (creates the "chain")
- Timestamp
- Nonce (Proof of Work)

```
Block 99              Block 100             Block 101
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ Prev: ...abc │◄─────│ Prev: ...xyz │◄─────│ Prev: ...def │
│ Hash: ...xyz │      │ Hash: ...def │      │ Hash: ...ghi │
│ Nonce: 12345 │      │ Nonce: 67890 │      │ Nonce: 24680 │
│ Txs: [...]   │      │ Txs: [...]   │      │ Txs: [...]   │
└──────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

**Immutability:**
If you try to change Block 100:
- Its hash changes
- Block 101's "previous hash" is now invalid
- Must re-mine Block 101
- But that changes Block 101's hash
- Must re-mine Block 102, 103, ... to the tip
- **Nearly impossible if chain is long!**

```python
# Validate entire blockchain
is_valid = blockchain.is_chain_valid()
# Checks all hashes, links, and Proof of Work
```

### 6. Network & Consensus

Bitcoin operates as a **peer-to-peer network**:
1. Nodes connect to peers
2. Transactions are broadcast to all nodes
3. Miners compete to mine blocks
4. Longest valid chain wins (most cumulative work)
5. All nodes sync to the longest chain

**This achieves consensus without central authority!**

```python
# P2P simulation
node1 = Node("Miner-1")
node2 = Node("Miner-2")
node1.connect_to_peer(node2)

# Broadcast transaction
node1.broadcast_transaction(tx)
# node2 receives it automatically
```

## 📖 Deep Dives

### Bitcoin Scripts

Bitcoin Script is a **stack-based programming language** used to define spending conditions for transaction outputs.

#### What is Bitcoin Script?

Every Bitcoin UTXO has a **locking script** (scriptPubKey) that defines conditions for spending it. To spend, you must provide an **unlocking script** (scriptSig) that satisfies those conditions.

**Example: P2PKH (Pay-to-PubKey-Hash)**

```
Locking Script (ScriptPubKey):
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Unlocking Script (ScriptSig):
<signature> <pubKey>

Execution (on a stack):
1. Push signature
2. Push pubKey
3. OP_DUP → Duplicate pubKey
4. OP_HASH160 → Hash the pubKey
5. Push expected pubKeyHash
6. OP_EQUALVERIFY → Check hashes match
7. OP_CHECKSIG → Verify signature
8. Result: TRUE ✅ (can spend) or FALSE ❌ (cannot spend)
```

#### Script Types Implemented

**1. P2PKH (Pay-to-PubKey-Hash)** - 90% of transactions
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.p2pkh_script_pubkey(pubkey_hash)
# Used for standard Bitcoin addresses
```

**2. P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash)** - Complex conditions
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.p2sh_script_pubkey(script_hash)
# Enables multisig, timelocks, etc.
```

**3. P2WPKH (SegWit)** - Lower fees, fixes malleability
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.p2wpkh_script_pubkey(pubkey_hash)
# bc1... addresses
```

**4. Multisig (2-of-3)** - Shared control
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.multisig_script_pubkey(2, [pk1, pk2, pk3])
# Requires any 2 of 3 signatures
```

**5. CLTV Timelock** - Funds locked until date/block
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.timelock_script_cltv(locktime, pubkey_hash)
# Cannot spend until Jan 1, 2026
```

**6. CSV Relative Timelock** - Funds locked for N blocks
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.timelock_script_csv(144, pubkey_hash)
# Can spend 144 blocks (~24 hours) after UTXO creation
```

**7. HTLC (Lightning Network)** - Hash + Time locks
```python
script = ScriptTemplates.htlc_script(hash_lock, timeout, recipient, sender)
# Recipient claims with preimage OR sender gets refund after timeout
```

#### Why Scripts Matter

- ✅ **Flexibility**: Support complex spending conditions
- ✅ **Security**: Mathematically provable conditions
- ✅ **Privacy**: Hide conditions until spending (P2SH)
- ✅ **Innovation**: Enable Lightning Network, smart contracts
- ✅ **Programmable Money**: "If X, then pay Y"

### Transaction Prioritization Problem

When a miner creates a block, they face an optimization problem:

**Given:**
- Mempool with thousands of pending transactions
- Each transaction has: fee, size, dependencies
- Block size limit: 1 MB

**Goal:**
Select transactions to maximize fees while respecting size limit and dependencies.

**This is a variant of the Knapsack Problem!**

#### Why This Matters

**For Miners:**
- More fees = more profit
- Competition: other miners are optimizing too
- Trade-off: larger blocks propagate slower

**For Users:**
- High-fee transactions confirm faster
- Understanding helps estimate fees
- CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) can unstuck transactions

**For Bitcoin:**
- Creates fee market
- Incentivizes miners
- Optimizes block space usage

#### Algorithms Implemented

**1. Greedy (Fee-per-Byte)**
```python
sorted_by_fee_rate = sort(transactions, by=fee/size, descending=True)
for tx in sorted_by_fee_rate:
    if fits_in_block(tx):
        include(tx)
```
- ⚡ Fast: O(n log n)
- ❌ Suboptimal: Misses high-fee chains

**2. Ancestor Set Mining (Bitcoin Core)**
```python
for each transaction:
    calculate ancestor_set (tx + all parents)
    score = total_fee / total_size
sort by score
greedily select highest-scoring sets
```
- ✅ Handles CPFP correctly
- ✅ Near-optimal in practice
- ⚡ Fast enough for production

**3. Dynamic Programming (Knapsack)**
```python
dp[i][w] = max(
    dp[i-1][w],              # don't take tx i
    dp[i-1][w-size[i]] + fee[i]  # take tx i
)
```
- ✅ Optimal (without dependencies)
- ❌ Too slow: O(n × 1MB) = impractical

**4. Simulated Annealing (Optimization)**
```python
current = greedy_solution
for iteration in iterations:
    neighbor = random_modification(current)
    if better(neighbor) or random_acceptance():
        current = neighbor
```
- ✅ Can escape local optima
- ✅ Tunable quality/speed
- ❌ No guarantees

#### CPFP (Child Pays For Parent)

**Problem:** You sent a transaction with too low fee. It's stuck!

**Solution:** Send another transaction (child) that:
- Spends an output from the stuck transaction (parent)
- Pays a very high fee

**Result:**
```
Parent: 1000 sat fee, 400 bytes → 2.5 sat/byte (stuck)
Child:  8000 sat fee, 300 bytes → 26.7 sat/byte

Combined package: 9000 sat / 700 bytes = 12.9 sat/byte
Miners include both to get the high fee!
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Ancestor set mining handles this automatically
ancestor_fee = parent.fee + child.fee
ancestor_size = parent.size + child.size
score = ancestor_fee / ancestor_size  # 12.9 sat/byte
```

#### Performance Results

Using realistic mempool (544 transactions):

| Algorithm | Txs Selected | Total Fee | Time |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Greedy | 450 | 8.5M sats | 0.3ms |
| **Ancestor Set** | **544** | **12.1M sats** | **1.2ms** |
| Simulated Annealing | 544 | 12.1M sats | 507ms |

**Winner:** Ancestor Set Mining
- 42% more fees than greedy
- Still very fast (1.2ms)
- Handles CPFP correctly
